</h3>

  <p align="center">
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is the largest transportation network in North America. The MTA network consists of the nation's largest bus fleet and more subway and commuter rail vehicles than all other United States. Nevertheless, transport companies were affected by the Corona epidemic economically. Therefore, officials and taxi owners will be provided with data on stations, crowded locations, and peak times so that they can increase the number of cars for the convenience of the passengers of each train and provide them with crowded stations or estimate fares in those areas and increase their income.
